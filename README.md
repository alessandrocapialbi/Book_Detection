# ðŸ“š Book Detection with SIFT & FLANN

This project detects multiple instances of books in scene images using **SIFT feature extraction**, **FLANN-based feature matching**, and **RANSAC homography**. It visualizes detected books with color-coded bounding boxes and computes internal metrics to assess detection quality.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Detect multiple instances of the same book in a scene.
- Color-coded bounding boxes per model.
- Iterative detection for crowded scenes.
- Internal quality metrics:
  - Number of good matches
  - Inlier ratio from RANSAC
  - Reprojection error
  - Bounding box area and aspect ratio
- Debug mode for visualizing keypoints, matches, and masks

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-detection.git
    cd book-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dependencies:

1. OpenCV (opencv-python)

2. NumPy

3. Matplotlib

4. Jupyter 


## Usage

1. Open the notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook book_detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute cells sequentially.

3. Provide paths for /models and /scenes folders if required.

Outputs:

Number of instances for each model and bounding boxes with drawn on scene images with different colors.

## Configuration

scale_factor: scale applied during preprocessing (default 3.0)

min_matches: minimum number of good matches for RANSAC (default 30)

colors: list of RGB colors for bounding boxes

debug: True to visualize intermediate results (keypoints, matches, masks)

## Example

Before detection:

After detection:
